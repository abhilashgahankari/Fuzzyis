# Fuzzy inference system
this is the 4th step in the ADM project which comes after applying GA for featuer selection (https://github.com/satishphale/genetic-feature-selection) followed by discretizing into equibins (https://github.com/abhilashgahankari/ADM_Project) followed by decision tree to get rules (https://github.com/aashitadutta/PerCapitaViolentCrimesPrediction)
matlab is used for the fuzzy inference system. rules from decision tree are configured in fis
main.fis has combination of trapezoidal and triangular membership functions .
trial.fis has triangular membership functions alone.
